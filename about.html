      <h1>ABOUT US</h1>

      So you've probably read our mission statement but want to know more, right? Well, you've come to the correct page.
      <br><br>
      <strong>SHAREWARE RECS</strong> is a one-person passion project ran out of a bedroom in Arcata, CA. My intent with this label is to provide a space for weird music to meet weird formats. Our primary release format will always be 3.5" floppy diskette; all releases must fit on a floppy disk in reduced quality (this usually works out to about ~4min of the lowest quality ogg I can export). We will also do additional runs of lathes, microcassette, or whatever else piques my interest.
      <br><br>
      Physical copies of 1.44MB floppies will sell for $4.20, as that covers my base unit cost and provides enough over to fund the next release run. I will fully fund every release and eat any additional costs that may be incurred; the tradeoff is that all money made at SHAREWARE RECS will go directly back into the acquisition of more floppy disks, ink, drives, modding gear, etc. This is a passion project, not a business, but it still requires time and dedication so I am taking a small profit if one is ever left beyond that.
      <br><br>
      Digital copies of our releases will always be free, forever. If you are interested in donating to us, get in contact via email (sharewarerecs@gmail.com) for my direct PayPal email, or add a tip on to a purchase of a physical copy of one of our releases.
      <br><br>
      I use "we" here because I believe that a label can be more than just the peson who runs it, and I would like to inspire that mentality. We are always open to comments, queries, and submissions. We would love to hear from you.
      <br><br>
      We appreciate you. :)
